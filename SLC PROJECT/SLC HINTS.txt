Supervised Learning - Classification and Ensemble Techniques

Develop a suitable machine learning model to predict and understand the credit defaulters. Interpret the developed model characteristics to understand the nature of credit defaulters. Validate and tune the model for better performance.

Skills and Tools

Machine Learning, Supervised Learning, Classification algorithm.


HINTS:
Logistic regression: Dataset: German Credit 
# Objective Estimate default probabilities using logistic regression. 

Steps and procedure to be followed: 

1.Load Libraries and data. 

2.Check how many records do we have.
 HINT: Use related pandas function to get shape. 

3.Plot Histogram for column 'CreditAmount'. 
HINT:  Use histogram plot from matplotlib library.

 4.Create creditability dataframe. 
HINT:  
Step 1:  Create a amountIntervalsPoints  like   np.array([0, 500, 1000,1500,2000, 2500, 5000, 7500, 10000, 15000, 20000])    
Step 2:       Create Amount Intervals with list which contains tuples with following condition. 
[(amountIntervalsPoints[i] + int(i != 0), amountIntervalsPoints[i + 1]) for i in np.arange(len(amountIntervalsPoints) - 1)]        
Step 3:       Create a dataframe using above amount intervals give a names for columns.    
Step 4:       Create two lists namely  Credibility0 = [] Credibility1 = []   

 Use for loop with AmountIntervals and use appropriate condtition to filter out the data. 



5.Concatenate the above 2 dataframes and give the total of Credibiliity0 and Credibiliity1. 
HINT: use concate function to combine the data frame and sum the two columns to create total column. 

6.Plot Creditworthiness plot for Credibility == 0 and also ==1. HINT: For Credibility == 0: 
Use plot method to plot the Creditworthiness by setting the required parameter in plot method. For Credibility == 1: 
Same as above just change credibility1 

7.Prepare input data for the model. HINT: Split Independent variable and dependent variable. 

8.Fit logistic regression model. 
HINT: Build Logistic model using SKlearn library or Stats Librabry. Use fit function to train the model. 


9.Test accuracy calculation. 
HINT: Get the predict values and store it in the variable for calculating the matrics.      

10. Build Confusion matrix.   
 HINT:       Use related matrix from sklearn.matrics to get confusion matrics and use related plot to visualize the confusion matrix.
 Ex: 10.Predicted Probability distribution Plots for Defaults and Non Defaults: 
HINT: Use two distribution plots for Defaults and Non Defaults in the same cell.
